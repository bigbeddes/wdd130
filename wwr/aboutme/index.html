    <h2>Ryan Beddes</h2>
    <h2>Big Beddes</h2>
    <p>I am currently married and have 3 sons under the age of 6. I currently work for the California Highway Patrol as their Lead IT tech in their Wireless Audio Video Recording System. I am working towards my Applied Technology BS degree with a focus in Web Programing and Database.</p> 
    <p>I enjoy playing PC video games with my friends, playing basketball and cooking/eating yummy food. My favorite food to cook/eat is Mexican food and smoked meats. I built my own Ugly Drum Smoker and added a bunch of cool features to it like air intake piping angled up to waist height with ball valves to control how much air I'm letting in.</p> 
    <p>I'm also an avid Back Yard Orchard Culture gardener. I've got 23 trees and vines planted in a very small space. some spots I have 4 trees growing in the space of 1 tree with the idea that I will prolong the fruiting season from 2 weeks to 2 months by having a quarter of the tree ripen at a time. My current project that I'm working on is getting mangos and Avocados to be established and graft multiple varieties onto one tree. I have failed at grafting several times (haven't succeeded yet) but enjoy the challenge and continue to watch other videos to try and improve my technique to hopefully find success in the near future.</p>
