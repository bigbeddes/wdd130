                    <h2>Thoughts on continuing education</h2>
                    <p>I have realized that if I want to advance my IT career, that my Associates Degree and years of experience will not be enough. That is the main reason I chose to yet again seek out to gain more education. I could have had my focus for my Bachelor Degree in desktop administration and network infrastructure and that would have been extremely easy for me to get. However, I wanted to gain skills in Web Programing, Python Scripting and Database Administration. I believe these skills well help me achieve my main desire which is to get involved into AWS cloud management.</p>

                    <p>My Web Programming Skills has helped me develop this website and I plan on continually updating this website to accurately reflect what I am capable of doing. Right now, those skills are centered around building out HTML and CSS pages.</p>

                    <h2>Python Scripting</h2>
                    <p>I really enjoy the Python classes I have taken so far and this is one of the main reasons I chose this education path was to master using Python. The research Iâ€™ve done with AWS has shown me that there are a lot of languages to use, but Python seems to be as close to a universal language that is used on several AWS platforms. Right now, my Python skills are in building lists, dictionaries, and functions and look forward to continue learn how to best maximize this programing language as well as others.</p>
