        Mission Statement
        <p>My Resume shows that I have several years of great experience and skills gained in the IT field. These skills are mostly centered around desktop/network/cloud infrastructure R&D implementation and support. I have developed additional skills with my education that will be beneficial to the position you are deciding if I would make a good candidate for. My goal is that the information provided on this website will not only keep your interest, but also prove that I am a great candidate for that position and worth interviewing and eventually hiring.
          <p>Values Statement
            <p>My IT job history proves that my core values align with Amazons leadership principles. One of those core examples is learn and be curious. My continual grind to seek higher education shows that I too seek to continually learn more skills that would be beneficial to advancing my professional career and make me a more desirable employee. This website will help better illustrate those skills gained through my continued quest to seek higher education.
              <p>Vision Statement
                <p>I know that not only am I a great candidate for the position you are looking to fill, but I would also become a highly valued member of your team if hired. I’ve proven this at every stop of my professional career. I started in IT with 0 experience and minimal education as a volunteer and quickly outperformed many of my coworkers and proved my value. That employer looked for ways they could hire me on full time which they eventually did. I have proven to be a highly valued employee at each of my IT employers and know I will continue to prove that I would be a highly valued employee at Amazon when hired.

      <h3>Associates Degree - Skills Gained</h3>
      <p>
        AS Degrees in Business Administration and Social Science
        <p>I have always enjoyed leading a group of people and my first educational focus reflected that mindset. The Business Administration helped me develop my foundational skills to better understand how to fit into any business and quickly identify the needs of the customer to develop a plan on how I can help fulfill those needs. I was also interested in the Social Science classes that helped me build a foundation to work well with everyone regardless of their cultural background.
          <p>IT Admin Classes
            <p>After I crushed my thumb helping my in-laws move, I realized that construction would not be a dependable career choice to support a family with since I was unable to work while I recovered from that injury. I quickly realized that IT would be a much more stable career choice since even with a crushed thumb I could still use WSAD spacebar to play my video games with. I then took the foundational IT classes that would help me get my foot in the door to find a job.  These classes helped me develop the foundational skills that I used in my IT career to date like desktop administration, windows server administration, network administration, and Microsoft Project to plan and successfully execute multiple multi-million-dollar projects.

      <h3>Bachelors Degree - Skills Gained</h3>
      <p>
        Thoughts on continuing education
        <p>I have realized that if I want to advance my IT career, that my Associates Degree and years of experience will not be enough. That is the main reason I chose to yet again seek out to gain more education. I could have had my focus for my Bachelor Degree in desktop administration and network infrastructure and that would have been extremely easy for me to get. However, I wanted to gain skills in Web Programing, Python Scripting and Database Administration. I believe these skills well help me achieve my main desire which is to get involved into AWS cloud management.
          <p>Web Programming
            <p>My Web Programming Skills has helped me develop this website and I plan on continually updating this website to accurately reflect what I am capable of doing. Right now, those skills are centered around building out HTML and CSS pages.
              <p>Python Scripting
                <p>I really enjoy the Python classes I have taken so far and this is one of the main reasons I chose this education path was to master using Python. The research I’ve done with AWS has shown me that there are a lot of languages to use, but Python seems to be as close to a universal language that is used on several AWS platforms. Right now, my Python skills are in building lists, dictionaries, and functions and look forward to continue learn how to best maximize this programing language as well as others.

        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The header image is logo with link to home as well, Image to right of Mission Statement is the skeleton gamer pic. Image to right of Values statement is gamer setup pic. Image to the right of Vision statement is old school computer stuff pic. Footer has my copyright and a link to my LinkedIn profile. The background will be navy and the text will be gold.

      <h3>Associates</h3>
      <p>         
        The three pics at the bottom might stay as is or might turn into a gallery, it depends on which I think will make the page look cleaner but right now I'm leaning towards 3 individual pics evenly spaced. The background will be left blank and text will be black.

      <h3>Bachelors</h3>
      <p>         
        I plan on transposing the text on top of each pic in a gallery. I plan on fading the picture until the gold text is clear to read.
