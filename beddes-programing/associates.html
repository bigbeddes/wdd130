                <h2>AS Degrees in Business Administration and Social Science</h2>
                <p>I have always enjoyed leading a group of people and my first educational focus reflected that mindset. The Business Administration helped me develop my foundational skills to better understand how to fit into any business and quickly identify the needs of the customer to develop a plan on how I can help fulfill those needs. I was also interested in the Social Science classes that helped me build a foundation to work well with everyone regardless of their cultural background.</p>

                <h2>IT Admin Classes</h2>
                <p>After I crushed my thumb helping my in-laws move, I realized that construction would not be a dependable career choice to support a family with since I was unable to work while I recovered from that injury. I quickly realized that IT would be a much more stable career choice since even with a crushed thumb I could still use WSAD spacebar to play my video games with. I then took the foundational IT classes that would help me get my foot in the door to find a job.  These classes helped me develop the foundational skills that I used in my IT career to date like desktop administration, windows server administration, network administration, and Microsoft Project to plan and successfully execute multiple multi-million-dollar projects.</p>
